Welcome to SHEPHERD's documentation!
====================================

To learn how *shepherd* enables research into the most challenging problems of coordinating battery-less sensor nodes, take a look at our `paper <https://wwwpub.zih.tu-dresden.de/~mzimmerl/pubs/geissdoerfer19shepherd.pdf>`_.
To get a basic understanding of what shepherd does, read the :doc:`user/basics`.
If you have the hardware on your desk and want to get started, read :doc:`user/getting_started`.
To record/emulate data on a group of shepherd nodes, use the :ref:`shepherd-herd-cli` command line utility.
