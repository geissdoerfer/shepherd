/**
 * Control loop
 *
 * The controller is best described as a Phase-Locked-Loop system: The kernel
 * module runs a reference clock with phase and frequency synchronized to the
 * network-wide master. The frequency equals the 'buffer period' and the phase
 * should be aligned to the wrap of the real time. E.g. if we have a buffer
 * period of 100ms, the timer should fire at X.1s, X.2s, X.3s and so on.
 * Our task is to copy that clock to the PRU's IEP. For this purpose, we run
 * a Linux hrtimer, that expires on the corresponding wrap of the Linux
 * CLOCK_REALTIME and we immediately trigger an interrupt on the PRU. The PRU
 * sends us its own phase via RPMSG. The goal of this function is to calculate
 * a 'correction factor' that is added to the IEP's frequency, such that the
 * difference between the phase of our clock and the IEP's is minimized.
 *
 * @param ctrl_rep Buffer to store the result of the control loop
 * @param ctrl_req Control request that was received from PRU0
